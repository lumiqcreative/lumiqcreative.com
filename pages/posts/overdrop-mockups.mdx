I’m helping to design Overdrop – a weather app [for
Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=widget.dd.com.overdrop.free&hl=en&gl=US)
and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/overdrop-weather/id1459855011). An elegant, unobtrusive
UI style is crucial for an information-heavy app.

On the Warnings screen, a dynamic icon comprising three exclamation points indicates
the severity of upcoming weather phenomena. Each warning is displayed as a
card, with a link to the source available.

<PostImage src='/overdrop-places.png' alt='Places screen.' />

The Places screen allows people to save their favourite locations and easily switch between them.
Overdrop can also detect the user’s location automatically and update it as they move.

<PostImage src='/overdrop-radar.png' alt='Weather radar.' />

The weather radar shows a panel with a scale and controls near the bottom of the screen.
The scale – ranging from blue to yellow – helps identify precipitation intensity, and a
slider lets people see imagery for the past and future. Because it uses a large range
of values, buttons are also provided to move three hours (the smallest increment) either way.
