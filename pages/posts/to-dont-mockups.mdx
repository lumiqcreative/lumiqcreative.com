I’ve designed the UI for To Don’t – an Android app aimed at helping people get rid of bad
habits. It’s centered around a filterable list of vices which refreshes every day. Visually
monotonous content called for a touch of visual flare, so a bold yellow header gives the app
a distinguishable look while also serving as a toolbar. It includes a list filter for effortless use.

The Log screen collects success stats for four time frames. It also allows changing the
status of habits for past days. Finally, a hint bubble is displayed to new users
on the home screen to help them get started.
